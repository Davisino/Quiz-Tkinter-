Bug1:
When the feedback was pushed to the DB, each row wasnt getting
the right quest_id. It turned out I was always passing the same
module id as a parameter in a function so that each feedback quest_id 
column would always have the same key as the module. 
To Solve this, I had to pass the current key of the question, so
First I had to find the question id of this question and then pass
it as a parameter. 
Bug2:
When looking up for fields on the database and also pushing data to
the DB I was encounter a bug that every time I did not convert
the integers into a string, they would not be pushed. To fixed this I 
simply had to surround each integer variable with str() method so that
it gets converted into a string.
